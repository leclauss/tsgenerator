.B @PROJECT_NAME@
\fB\-l\fR INTEGER \fB\-w\fR INTEGER \fB\-rd\fR FLOAT [\fBOPTIONS\fR]
.SH DESCRIPTION
The \fI@PROJECT_NAME@\fR is a generator of synthetic time series and the result of a student research project. The idea was born, since the range of implementations generating synthetic time series specialized for evaluation of time series motif discovery algorithms was non-existing. This project is intended as a cross platform implementation. Therefore, the \fI@PROJECT_NAME@\fR was tested on Kubuntu 17.10, Windows 10 and macOS 10.13 High Sierra.

\fIMETHOD:\fR
.TP
The available methods are \fBsimpleRandomWalk\fR, \fBrealRandomWalk\fR, \fBnormalRandomWalk\fR, \fBlinearRandomWalk\fR, \fBboundedSimpleRandomWalk\fR, \fBboundedRealRandomWalk\fR, \fBboundedNormalRandomWalk\fR, \fBboundedLinearRandomWalk\fR, \fBuniformRandom\fR, \fBnormalRandom\fR, \fBpiecewiseLinearRandom\fR and \fBsplineRepeated\fR.
.TP
\fBsimpleRandomWalk\fR:
.br
The base time series is generated by performing a simple random walk. The simple walk generates data based on the previous generated value v_i. The next value v_{i + 1} is either v_i - \fBdelta\fR or v_i + \fBdelta\fR.
.TP
\fBrealRandomWalk\fR:
.br
The base time seires is generated by performing a real random walk. The real random walk generates data based on the previous generated value v_i. The next value v_{i + 1} is v_i + s where s is a random real value in the range [-\fBdelta\fR, \fBdelta\fR) with uniform distribution.
.TP
\fBnormalRandomWalk\fR:
.br
The base time seires is generated by performing a real random walk. The real random walk generates data based on the previous generated value v_i. The next value v_{i + 1} is v_i + s where s is a random real value in the range [-\fBdelta\fR, \fBdelta\fR) with normal distribution.
.TP
\fBlinearRandomWalk\fR:
.br
The base time series is generated by performing a modified real random walk. The linear random walk generates data by computing a value v_{i + 1} = v_i + s with normal distributed value s and the corresponding x_{i + i} = x_i + t according to a poisson distribution with mean step for t where the previous coordinate is x_i, v_i. Intermidiate values are linear approximated.
.TP
\fBboundedSimpleRandomWalk\fR:
.br
The base time series is generated by performing a modified simple random walk. When the value v_i + s is larger then \fBmaxi\fR the value v_{i + 1} is set to v_i - |s| and when the value v_i + s is smaller than -\fBmaxi\fR the value v_{i + 1} is set to v_i + |s|.
.TP
\fBboundedRealRandomWalk\fR:
.br
The base time series is generated by performing a modified real random walk. When the value v_i + s is larger then \fBmaxi\fR the value v_{i + 1} is set to v_i - |s| and when the value v_i + s is smaller than -\fBmaxi\fR the value v_{i + 1} is set to v_i + |s|.
.TP
\fBboundedNormalRandomWalk\fR:
.br
The base time series is generated by performing a modified normal random walk. When the value v_i + s is larger then \fBmaxi\fR the value v_{i + 1} is set to v_i - |s| and when the value v_i + s is smaller than -\fBmaxi\fR the value v_{i + 1} is set to v_i + |s|.
.TP
\fBboundedLinearRandomWalk\fR:
.br
The base time series is generated by performing a modified linear random walk. When the value v_i + s is larger then \fBmaxi\fR the value v_{i + 1} is set to v_i - |s| and when the value v_i + s is smaller than -\fBmaxi\fR the value v_{i + 1} is set to v_i + |s|.
.TP
\fBuniformRandom\fR:
.br
The base time series is generated by computing uniform distributed values in the range [-\fBdelta\fR / 2, \fBdelta\fR / 2].
.TP
\fBnormalRandom\fR:
.br
The base time series is generated by computing normal distributed values with mean 0 and standard deviation \fBdelta\fR / 2.
.TP
\fBpiecewiseLinearRandom\fR:
.br
The base time series is generated by computing piecewise distributed values with intervals \fB-delta\fR / 2, -\fBdelta\fR / 4, 0, \fBdelta\fR / 4, \fBdelta\fR / 2 and weights 0, 10, 0, 10, 0.
.TP
\fBsplineRepeated\fR:
.br
The base time series is generated by computing \fBtimes\fR many pairs x_{i + 1}, v_{i + 1} where x_{i + 1} = x_i + t with uniform distributed value t and v_{i + 1} = v_i + s with uniform distributed value s. A cubic spline is drawn throw the value pairs. The cubic spline is repeatedly added to the time series with different noise values.

.SH OUTPUT
The @PROJECT_NAME@ creates an output folder and three files. A \fBtime_series.csv\fR file, a \fBtime_series_meta.csv\fR file and a \fBtime_series_plot.plt\fR file. 
.TP
.B time_series.csv
Contains the synthetic time series values.
.TP
.B time_series_meta.csv
Contains the synthetic time series motif meta data. Each data set first value is the similarity of the synthetic time series top pair motif or the range of the synthetic time series top latent motif. The second value is the window size of the synthetic time series top pair motif or the synthetic time series top latent motif followed by all the positions of the subsequences in the synthetic time series top pair motif or the synthetic time series top latent motif matching subseqeunces positions in the synthetic time series.
